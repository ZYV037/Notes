1. import *.sql: mysql -uroot -p123456 -hlocalhost chengtan2015 < MyProject/chengtan2015/chengtan2015.sql --default-character-set=utf8
   chengtan2015.sql is about 100Mb size.

2. after import update table data immediately.

3. may sql/update very slow to 3 second.

Reason:
 after import sql, mysql will update index background. 
 if you do update immediately, the index may be destroyed.
 so the index failed, and your sql will be very slow.

resolution:
   after import .sql file, you'd better check the index effected or not.
   explain select channelid form WaveDataInfo where channel_id = 2;
   if the type is range, the index successed.
   if not, wait a second to check index effect.
