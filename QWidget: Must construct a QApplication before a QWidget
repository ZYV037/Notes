QWidget: Must construct a QApplication before a QWidget

This error waste me more than fucking 3 days,and hurt my heart.

Reason:In porject, some dynamic lib use release qt lib like QT5core.dll,QT5Widget.dll...,and some other depends on debug qt lib like QT5cored.dll...
       And than you run you fucking release programe, it's just cannot start.You try to debug you programe and run debug, thie error occured.
